Surabhi's submission failed to display a deep enough familiarity and experience with modern tools, with the Javascript language, and with code cleanliness and organization. Surabhi is clearly intelligent, and does have a working understanding of the basic fundamentals of web development, but I would encourage her to seek mentorship from an experienced engineer to help clear up some of the important blind spots in her approach.
 
To be more specific:
- A lack of clear separation of concerns within parts of the app. For example, code that involves the display of information on the screen is tightly woven into code that involves getting information from the server. This means changes in design can affect totally unrelated parts of the codebase, which is something we want to avoid.
- A failure to structure and work with data in an expressive and logical way. Extra steps are taken to transform the information that is passed through the app in a way that makes the code much more difficult to follow and does not offer any significant improvement in return. The server does not need to transform the results it receives from the search query. 
- A failure to display a familiarity with modern tools and technology. We don't really mind if the applicant chooses to use technology other than what we use here at iHeartRadio, but Surabhi's choice of technology suggests a programmer who is very close to the beginning of her journey with web development. Again, I do believe that with more real world experience and mentorship she could be a great candidate, but she's just not there yet.
